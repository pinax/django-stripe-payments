# Middleware

Add `"pinax.stripe.middleware.ActiveSubscriptionMiddleware"` to the middleware settings if you need to limit access to 
urls for only those users with an active subscription.

Settings that should be setup for use of this middleware can be found in
[the SaaS documentation](../user-guide/saas.md).
